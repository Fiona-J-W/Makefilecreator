Maintargets
----------
* *readable* makefiles
* intelligent defaults
* easy usage


******


BUGS
----
* relative dirs are wrong, if '/' is the common root

Should be done
--------------
* consistent makefiles (independent, from where you create them)

Nice to have
------------
* really *understand* the preprocessor
* real dependency detection, based on code
* detection of directory-structures and therefore intelligent defaults (opt out)
* multiple targets
* simple settings-header
* automatic detection of templates and suitable handling of these files

Won't implement
---------------
* High-Level-scripting (use cmake, if your project is that big)
